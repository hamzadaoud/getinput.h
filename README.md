# getinput.h
that is how you would call it if you want to use it , so a description of this code 
This code is a C program that demonstrates the use of functions for inputting various data types (integer, float, double, character, and string) from the user, and then printing the inputted values to the console. The program consists of five functions (get_int, get_float, get_double, get_char, and get_string) that each handle input for a specific data type, as well as a get_input function that takes in a prompt, a pointer to the result, and a format specifier and calls the appropriate input function based on the format specifier. The main function then calls the get_input function multiple times to input values for each of the data types, and finally prints out the inputted values using printf statements. The inputted string is dynamically allocated using the getline function and is freed using the free function before the program exits. 
I don't know if i would keep updating the code since I completed the course , but probably it's a fine code .
